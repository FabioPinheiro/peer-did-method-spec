<h1>Security Considerations</h1>

<section class="informative">
    <h2>Guarantees</h2>
    <p>This spec uses a <a target="aries"
            href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md#what-is-a-protocol">
        protocol</a>, rather than a public oracle, as the root of trust. This protocol reliably communicates data
        about peer DIDs and peer DID docs; peers must persist that data into a local cache or database that functions
        as the <a target="didspec" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#dfn-dir">Decentralized Identifier
            Registry</a> for the method. The method is worthy of trust because it guarantees the following properties:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>DIDs are associated with exactly one <a>inception key</a> pair at the moment of creation.</dt>
        <dd>This prevents a category of man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could rotate a DID's keys
            at the outset of a relationship, unbeknownst to peers. It also prevents any party other than the holder
            of the inception key from using the DID in an unintended context.
        </dd>
        <dt>DIDs have an acceptable level of uniqueness.</dt>
        <dd>This is NOT a guarantee that DIDs will never be improperly reused by their owner, NOR is it a guarantee that
            collusion cannot subvert uniqueness. Thus, it is not a uniqueness upon which deep trust can be based.
            Rather, it is a guarantee that good behavior will not produce accidental collisions. In this
            sense, it is a bit like the uniqueness offered by NATing mechanisms in IPv4. It provides
            enough uniqueness that a DID can be used as an index in a database or as a routing target
            in DID communication. It also makes it possible for blockchains to <a href="#grafting">graft</a> a peer
            DID by mapping it into their namespace, without incurring the risk of ambiguity. Any time a peer
            DID is discovered to be less than unique, a true problem exists and systems can fairly
            raise an exception.
        </dd>
        <dt>The values of DIDs are securely random.</dt>
        <dd>This prevents attackers from discovering patterns in DIDs that might undermine privacy.
        </dd>

    <h2>Enforcement</h2>

    <p>In centralized systems, security is enforced at the center. This is so obvious that we take it for
        granted&mdash;you can't access a database unless you log in first, and it's the database that enforces
        this.
    </p>
    <p>Despite their other decentralized features, blockchains are no different in this respect. If a
        blockchain accepts updates to a DID doc, then the blockchain must guarantee that those updates are
        only made by authorized parties. Thus, most DID methods imagine a blockchain parsing the
        authorization section of a DID doc, and rejecting mischief from hackers.
    </p>
    <p>However, in a peer relationship, there IS no centralized authority. This leads to an interesting
        inversion of responsibility that must be understood: Bob enforces Alice's
            authorization policy, and Alice enforces Bob's.
    </p>
    <p>This might seem wrong&mdash;shouldn't Alice enforce her own security? But it is quite rational. Who cares
        whether the agents he is dealing with truly belong to Alice and are authorized by her? Bob does.
        And if one of Alice's agents gets hacked and attempts to subvert the Alice:Bob relationship,
        who is the uncontaminated party that can refuse to cooperate with the rogue agent? Bob is.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to think about this is that, within the Alice:Bob relationship, Bob acts as a substitute
        for a centralized resource that Alice's agents try to access. In such a mental model, of course, Bob
        would be a logical place to enforce access rules for Alice.

    <h2>Secure communication</h2>
    <p>All the messages in this protocol (except for a connection invitation that requires no security, by design)
        must be sent encrypted, using the encryption format specified in <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0019-encryption-envelope/README.md">
            DIDComm's encryption envelope</a>. This gives strong guarantees about the confidentiality and integrity of
        exchanged data, regardless of the transport mechanism used to transmit the messages.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Proof of Control</h2>
    <p>Because peer DIDs are generated from an <a href="#generation-method">algorithm</a> that includes the values of their initial public key(s)
        as input, they cannot be created without the creator controlling them. As mentioned earlier, this prevents
        man-in-the-middle attacks at the time of creation. A man-in-the-middle attacker might still try to exchange 
		the public key(s) in a DID Doc, while keeping the DID the same. If unnoticed, this would bind a DID generated
		by an honest party to the attacker's public key(s). To prevent this, the receiver of a freshly generated peer
		DID and DID Doc must verify that the DID was properly generated using the <a href="#generation-method">algorithm</a>.
		This check is required when the received (DID, DID Doc) pair was not otherwise authenticated, which is the case
		for the exchange request during <a href="#create-register">peer DID Exchange</a>.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Entropy</h2>
    <p>
        Since keys must be created from keys generated by a secure random number generator, they are guaranteed
        to be unpredictable and globally unique at creation time.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Key Management</h2>
    <p>Keys used to control peer DIDs, or keys authorized to communicate and update the DID docs
        for peer DIDs, should be managed according to best practices for DKMS, as described in
        <a target="aries" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0051-dkms/dkms-v4.md">
        the DKMS spec</a>.

    <h2>Handling the trust-on-first-use (TOFU) problem</h2>
    <p>
        The trust-on-first-use is described in detail in its
        <a target="wikipedia"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use">Wikipedia
        article</a>. In brief, the TOFU problem occurs because it's not possible
        to verify on receipt of a public key, who is the owner of the
        corresponding private key. This lack of knowledge enables Man in the
        Middle (MITM) attacks, where an attempt to establish a connection
        between two participants is compromised by a third party. With peer:did,
        the interaction most vulnerable to MITM attacks is when an invitation is
        sent in plaintext to start the establishment of a connection. Recall
        that a plaintext invitation (a URL, a QR code, etc.) is needed when
        there is no way for two parties that want to connect to send an
        encrypted message. A relatively simple MITM attack using an intercepted
        invitation is for the MITM to respond to the invitation and establish a
        connection with the inviter, pretending to be the invitee. In a more
        sophisticated attack, the MITM sends a second, replacement
        MITM-generated invitation to the intended invitee, establishes a
        connection with that party, responds to the original invitation, and
        establishes a connection with the inviter. That second attack example
        could allow the MITM to remain between the two communicating parties,
        proxying messages between them, and intervening when it is advantageous.
        Since it is such a complex attack, it is viewed as extremely unlikely
        (arguably, impossible) to occur in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two common approaches to handling the TOFU problem with
        connections established using the peer DID method specification. One is
        to verify the connection using a trusted third party channel, and the second
        is through the use of verifiable credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that in many use cases, an entity might not care who responds to an
        invitation. In that case an "intercepted" invitation is OK, and might
        even be encouraged as a way to get more connections. For example a
        service where users only put in data for their own use (for example, a
        time tracking app) would not care who establishes a connection, just
        that the service has a reliable way to know whenever an entity returns
        to the service. In that case, neither verification method is necessary.
        It might only be when the user becomes a paying client that the service
        needs stronger credentials from whomever it is that is using the service.

    <h3>Verification Using a Trusted Third Party Channel</h3>
    <p>
        Verifying that the established connection is with the intended party
        using a trusted third party channel is done by sending a request by
        some means other than the newly established connection, and having
        the response returned on (or about) the established connection. For
        example, after establishing the connection, the inviter might
        telephone the invitee and verbally confirm the public key the
        invitee is using for the connection. Of course, such an approach is
        neither user friendly, nor does it scale. The challenge is finding
        approaches that are reliable, easy and that scale. Another approach
        might be to email a message to the invitee and have them respond via
        the new connection with a phrase from the email. While that approach
        would detect the first example MITM attack (described above), it would
        not detect the second.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user experience can be improved as well using a <a target="superuser" href="https://superuser.com/questions/22535/what-is-randomart-produced-by-ssh-keygen">randomart image</a> generated from a public key while being able to detect both the first and second MITM attack examples. This image could be sent in numerous ways such as embedding it in a qr code, sending it over a email, or text message would also work.

    <h3>Using Verifiable Credentials</h3>
    <p>
        The use of <a target="W3C"
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>
        is another way to verify a connection. With the connection in place, one
        party requests from the other a verifiable presentation of third party
        claims made about them. The requested claims should be sufficient to
        mitigate the risk for the transactions to be carried out using the
        connection, possibly including (but not just) the detection of a MITM
        attack. Note that such risk mitigation should be done by both connected
        parties. For example, a company might need to know some identity
        information about a new client, and the new client might want to be
        certain that the company is who they claim to be as attested to by an
        authorized entity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The presentation of verifiable claims is sufficient
        to handle the first example MITM attack&mdash;the presentation
        provides sufficient information about the other entity to continue
        the relationship. However, because in the second example, the MITM
        can proxy the presentation request and presentation between the
        parties, a verifiable presentation might not be sufficient to detect
        the second MITM example. In that case, we also want proof that the
        entity that delivered the presentation is the same entity that
        constructed the presentation. Since in the case of did:peer the
        delivery is by definition through a did:peer enabled connection,
        that extra proof involves linking the construction of the
        presentation to the connection through which it will be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        This extra proof can be achieved by having the entity constructing the
        presentation include a self-attested claim that is the did:peer
        public key of the prover. When the presentation is received, the
        verifier can compare the signed, self-attested claim with the one
        they are holding in the did:peer DIDDoc for the connection. If they
        do not match it is possible there has been a MITM attack and the
        connection is suspect.
